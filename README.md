This is progress from a machine learning class project using python. 
It includes several iterations, some abandoned, of attempts at making a working/useful machine learning pipeline for predicting the outcome of
individual pitches in baseball using Statcast data scraped from BaseballReference using pybaseball. 

The csv file used in training the model is too large to upload to github, so it is kept locally. 

The data scraped used 2024 regular season data, marked by the dates in the statcast scraper. 

DataBreakdown.py and DataBreakdown2.py are some data visualizations we used. 

BaseballClassifier.py was the first program we created, which was not a flushed out start, but it ended up having the best performance on the 
training vs testing sets.

Following iterations did not yield better results, but the problem changed.

NewPipeline.py is the simple iteration of the pipeline that performs the best and PipelineFinalONE.py contains exploration of more modelling techinques.
